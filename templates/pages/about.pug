        | Jonathan is brilliant in a particular way I notice: He can take
        | complex knowledge and break it down into 
        span.b simple, understandable language
        |. He simplifies complexity and complexifies simplicity,
        | wherever the natural direction is for knowledge to become more
        | 'known', alive, shared. 
        span.b He listens
        |  with this skill as well, which 
        | makes him able to focus and expand people simultaneously. 
        | It's a beautiful gift.

        |Anybody can claim to be 
        span.b solution oriented, resourceful or creative
        | . 
        | However, it doesn't mean much if you don't "get it" first. Getting
        | it means having 
        span.b the curiosity to understand the industry
        |, the clients, the technology, the risks, the deadlines, etc. This is a
        | necessity before channeling your thoughts and actions toward a
        | greater outcome.
      p 
        | Already in our first meetings, you can see the gears spinning in his
        | mind. That's how you know someone is invested, that they are thinking
        | instead of spitting out the latest buzzwords. It is such a relief to
        | work with the kind of person you can rely on
        |. This is the very basis of 
        span.b building a trust relationship.
      p To put it in simple words, well, Jonathan, he "gets it".
