title: Things you're gonna need for your basic electronics lab

I have been slowly gathering basic tools and components for my electronics lab 
and I thought that maybe sharing the list would be helpful to someone else!

## What you're gonna need

### Tools

##### Electrical Tools

- **A multimeter**: 50$ minimum. No more than 100$. You might want to get two, 
because sometimes you need to read both volts and amps at the same time.
- **An oscilloscope**: You can get an old CRT one for cheap. If you get a newer 
USB model, make sure it has proper USB isolation. 
- **A power supply**: Consider making this one yourself as one of your first 
electronics project.
- **A function generator**: Generate waveforms, provide test signals.
- **A soldering iron**: Get one that has a temperature-controlled station. 
- **A Fume extractor**: At the very least, get the fumes out of your face.
- **A Glue gun**: 'nuff said. 
- **Microscope**: You can get a digital (USB) microscope for pretty cheap.

##### Hand tools

- **Breadboards**: You test circuits with these.
- **Magnifier**: Get a self-standing one with clips.
- **Tweezers**
- **Cable Cutters**
- **Pliers**

### Hardware

#### Items

- **Tip cleaner**: For cleaning you soldering iron as you go.
- **Solder**: You probably want 0.4 mm.
- **Glue sticks**: For the glue gun.
- **Flux pen**: (As opposed to flux paste or liquid flux with a syringe). More convenient for beginners, requires less maintenance, and is easier to store.
- **Jumper wire**: For the breadboard.
- **Hook-up wire**: For the perboards.
- **Wire wrap**: Electrical tape can do the job but this is more convenient!
- **Perfboards (DOT PCB)**: You build permanent circuits on these.

#### Components

You can get all of these in kits for pretty cheap.

- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Inductors
- Transistors
- Diodes
- LEDs
- Buck converters
