      h1 Cybersecurity advisory services
  article.lh-copy

    p You're a crypto/web3 or fintech founder looking to ensure your application is as secure as possible—ideally without slowing down development.

    p You've been able to manage the details of your security program so far, but your engineering team is growing and your infrastructure is getting more complex.

    p You take security very seriously and understand the importance of getting it right the first time.

    p You have employed the help of the industry’s best auditing firms to inspect your application code for any vulnerabilities.

    p You believe in holding yourself to a high security standard but you also know you need to prioritize high-speed product and market growth. 

    p What if you could hire a neutral advisor to handle the strategy, planning, and oversight of your security practices so you can focus on building your product and growing your business?

    h2 Does any of this sound like you?

    ol
      li You are growing, hiring, and building at the fastest speed possible.
      li You have strong technical people on your team but lack a person who specializes in security processes.
      li You hire developers of varying degrees of seniority and you want to empower them to do their best work in an efficient yet secure manner.
      li You’re currently treating security initiatives as one-off projects—like audits or fixes—and not an ongoing process that is part of everything you do.
      li You have no measurable way to assess how much  total cyber risk you currently have.

    h2 What if you could...

    ol
      li 
        | Have someone on your team you can trust to advise you on what, when,
        | and how to resource your information security efforts.
      li
        | Know that your company is staying on top of the latest security
        | threats, vulnerabilities and events that could impact your business.
      li 
        | Scale cybersecurity within your organization as you grow—not as an
        | afterthought to be fixed later on.
      li Have an easy way to track progress and develop an informed cybersecurity roadmap
      li Forecast realistic costs for improvement projects.
      li Have a continuous, accurate picture of your security posture.
      li Always have up to date documentation of your security practices and standards.

    blockquote
      p 
        | Jonathan is brilliant in a particular way I notice: He can take
        | complex knowledge and break it down into simple, understandable
        | language. He simplifies complexity and complexifies simplicity,
        | wherever the natural direction is for knowledge to become more
        | 'known', alive, shared. He listens with this skill as well, which
        | makes him able to focus and expand people simultaneously. 
        | It's a beautiful gift.

      p 
        | Anybody can claim to be solution oriented, resourceful or creative. 
        | However, it doesn't mean much if you don't "get it" first. Getting
        | it means having the curiosity to understand the industry, the
        | clients, the technology, the risks, the deadlines, etc. This is a
        | necessity before channeling your thoughts and actions toward a
        | greater outcome.
      p 
        | Already in our first meetings, you can see the gears spinning in his
        | mind. That's how you know someone is invested, that they are thinking
        | instead of spitting out the latest buzzwords. It is such a relief to
        | work with the kind of people you can rely on. This is the very basis
        | of building a trust relationship.
      p To put it in simple words, well, Jonathan "he gets it".
