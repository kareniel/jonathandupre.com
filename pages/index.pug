      h1 Security gets easier when you keep things simple

  article.lh-copy
    p 
      | You're a 
      strong web3 
      | or 
      strong fintech
      | founder looking to ensure your application is  
      strong as secure as expected
      |—ideally 
      strong without slowing down 
      | development.

    p 
      | You've been able to manage the details of your security program so far,
      | but your engineering team is growing and your infrastructure is getting more 
      strong complex.

    p
      | You take security very seriously and understand the importance of 
      strong putting the right systems in place.

    p
      | You believe in holding yourself to a high security standard but you also 
      | have other priorities, like 
      strong shipping features 
      | and 
      strong meeting KPIs. 

    p
      | What if you could hire 
      strong an independent advisor 
      | to help you with the strategy,
      | planning, and oversight of your security practices so you can 
      strong focus on building 
      | your product without putting your business at risk?

    h2 Does any of this sound like you?

    ol
      li You are growing, hiring, and building as fast as you possibly can. 
      li You have strong technical people on your team but lack a person who is 
        strong dedicated to security  
        | processes.
      li You hire developers of varying degrees of seniority and you want to 
        strong empower them 
        | to do their best work in an efficient yet 
        strong secure 
        | manner.
      li You’re currently treating security initiatives as one-off 
        | projects—like audits or fixes—and not yet as 
        strong an ongoing process 
        | that is part of everything you do.
      li You have no 
        strong measurable 
        | way to assess how much total cyber risk you currently have and 
        | the potential impact on your business.

    h2 What if you could...

    ol
      li 
        | Have someone on your team who is a 
        strong dedicated expert 
        | to advise you on what, when,
        | and how to resource your information security efforts.
      li
        | Have confidence that your company is 
        strong staying on top 
        | of the latest security
        | threats, vulnerabilities and events that could impact your business.
      li 
        strong Scale 
        | cybersecurity within your organization 
        strong as you grow
        |, baking security in the DNA of your team.
      li Have an easy way to 
        strong track progress 
        |, develop an 
        strong informed cybersecurity roadmap 
        | and establish priorities.
      li Forecast 
        strong realistic 
        | costs for improvement projects.
      li Have a 
        strong continuous
        | and 
        strong accurate 
        | picture of your security posture.
      li Always have 
        strong up to date documentation 
        | of your security practices and standards.

        strong the right people 
        | to perform regular security audits.
      li Architect systems using

    h2 Testimonials

    blockquote
      p 
        | Jonathan is brilliant in a particular way I notice: He can take
        | complex knowledge and break it down into simple, understandable
        | language. He simplifies complexity and complexifies simplicity,
        | wherever the natural direction is for knowledge to become more
        | 'known', alive, shared. He listens with this skill as well, which
        | makes him able to focus and expand people simultaneously. 
        | It's a beautiful gift.

    blockquote 
      p 
        |Anybody can claim to be solution oriented, resourceful or creative. 
        | However, it doesn't mean much if you don't "get it" first. Getting
        | it means having the curiosity to understand the industry, the
        | clients, the technology, the risks, the deadlines, etc. This is a
        | necessity before channeling your thoughts and actions toward a
        | greater outcome.
      p 
        | Already in our first meetings, you can see the gears spinning in his
        | mind. That's how you know someone is invested, that they are thinking
        | instead of spitting out the latest buzzwords. It is such a relief to
        | work with the kind of people you can rely on. This is the very basis
        | of building a trust relationship.
      p To put it in simple words, well, Jonathan, he "gets it".
