        | Jonathan is brilliant in a particular way I notice: He can take
        | complex knowledge and break it down into simple, understandable language. He simplifies complexity and complexifies simplicity,
        | wherever the natural direction is for knowledge to become more
        | 'known', alive, shared. 
      p He listens with this skill as well, which 
        | makes him able to focus and expand people simultaneously. 
        | It's a beautiful gift.

    blockquote 
      p 
        |Anybody can claim to be solution oriented, resourceful or creative. 
        | However, it doesn't mean much if you don't "get it" first. Getting
        | it means having the curiosity to understand the industry, the clients, the technology, the risks, the deadlines, etc. This is a
        | necessity before channeling your thoughts and actions toward a
        | greater outcome.
      p To put it in simple words, well, Jonathan "gets it".
