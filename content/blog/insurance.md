Your goal is not to make the insurance provider happy.

It's to make the insurance provider happy, AND to make sure they are willing to give you money when something bad happens.

If you check the box, but then you don't keep checking it, you risk having to pay the settlement out of pocket.

That gives you two options:

1. Make sure you have enough cash saved up.
2. Understand the requirements of your insurance plan.
