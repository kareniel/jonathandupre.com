The security decisions you make as a business owner come down to two things:

1. How much to spend
2. On what

How much should you spend to protect a sandwich?

It depends on how much you can tolerate dry bread.

OK, so what should you use?

There are many options. You could use foil, a sandwich bag, or a plastic container. They have different price points, and different properties. They also involve different operations. 

For example, containers are more expensive upfront and you always loose the lids, but you save money over their lifetime. Foil is cheap and in some places recyclable, but if you don't wrap it properly, your sandwich might get exposed. 

How much you spend depends on what's at stake. In other words, how much assurance do you need? That's how much you should spend.

What you spend it on is what brings risk to a tolerable level, at the cheapest price.

You don't know much. What's the probability of X? I don't know.

You spend money, but you don't know if you're spending enough.

That's a good question to ask, "Am I spending enough on security"?

How do you measure the cost of a decision?

You can measure the cost of making the wrong decision.

When you decide, you select from a set of options.

You measure the value of perfect information.

Perfect information guarantees the accurate prediction of what the future holds.

It's the price of perfect information.

It's going to rain between 12 and 5, and I have to walk 5 km.
Should I bring an umbrella?

That's the price you would pay to have access 

You don't put a process in place until you have a way to measure if it's successful.
