title: Default to safe, private and secure

I get at this point between 5-10 Discord DMs a day.
100% of those DMs are scams having to do with NFTs, tokens or DAO governance.
This happens partly because I regularly join new Discord servers.

People regularily get scammed through this channel and the total amount of value lost sounds ridiculous. 

To avoid getting spammed/scammed, you can toggle a switch in each-individual-server-that-you-join's privacy settings. The label reads: "Allow direct messages from server members".

This option is turned on by default.

Discord PMs probably had to make a trade-off between usability and security. I'm not sure.
But you can't avoid this decision. You always have to pick a default setting.
