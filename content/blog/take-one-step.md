- **Build tools around the development process**. Optimize for developer workflows.
- **Write specifications for your systems**. You probably won't do it before you start shipping code but it's never too late.
- **Monitor running systems**. Be able to know what state your system is in, from development to production.

Improving your security maturity so that you're able to trust your systems more as time goes on.
