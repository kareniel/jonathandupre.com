There are many ways you can take steps to create a continuous improvement cycle.

- **Simplify the architecture**. Lower cognitive overhead means less bugs.
- **Build tools around the development process**. Optimize for developer workflows.
- **Write specifications**. You probably won't do it before you start shipping code but it's never too late.
- **Monitor running systems**. You want to be able to know what state your system is in, from development to production.

Improve your system security so that you're able to trust your systems more as time goes on.

You can't depend on an external company to own this work for you.

Build capacity instead of dependency. It's core to your business to understand your product and to be able to manage it.
