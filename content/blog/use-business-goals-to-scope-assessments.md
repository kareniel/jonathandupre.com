There are 3 things that can happen to your critical data, from a security perspective.

Your data can be disclosed, corrupted, or denied of access.

If you are looking for a way to scope a risk assessment, consider using one of your business goals.

Let's say you want to close 10 deals over the next quarter. To achieve that goal, you will use computers to access all kinds of data. It might be customer information, financials, or contracts. It might be historical records, a list of some sort, or maybe a piece of code.

If it supports you in reaching your business goals, it's part of the scope.
