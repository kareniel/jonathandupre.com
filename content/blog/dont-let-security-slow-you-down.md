Security people sometimes get a bad reputation for our attitudes. Our role involves protecting, so we say "no" a lot. 

And we're always the ones with the bad news. Always bringing up problems, or [issues](that-one-integration), or dangers, or weaknesses.

People always ask us for exceptions. And we get in their way. All the time.

Don't let us tell you "no". Don't let security slow you down. 

Just make sure you know how safe it is to go that fast.
