Today, I had the chance to review someone's resume and give a bit of advice. I thought I'd post part of my reply here since it might be helpful to other people.

> Here are some answers I'd be looking for when hiring for a pentester or a cybersecurity analyst position:
> 
> 1. Can I trust this person to be autonomous and do the work without needing too much supervision?
> 2. Will this person be a good fit for my team?
> 3. Can this person understand the impact of their findings on my client's business?
> 4. Will this person be able to write clear, consistent and error-free reports?
> 
> To answer these questions I'm gonna make assumptions based on the information you provide me.
> 
> The more you speak in terms of outcomes you have achieved, and the more those outcomes match those I am looking for, for my team and my client, the more I'm gonna be curious and interested in talking to you.
