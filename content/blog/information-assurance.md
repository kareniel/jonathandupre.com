Think of the information you exposed to your favorite vendor.

1. What you showed and told them.
2. What you sent them a copy of.
3. What notes they have about you.

Consider the dynamics of each of these sets.

From you, to them, to their organization, to the outside world.

You had conversations, you transferred files. They made evaluations and computations. They took notes and will remember things.

We are custodians of each other's private information.

And information spreads like ink in water.

If you can assure me, maybe I can trust you.
