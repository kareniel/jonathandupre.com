You have a lot of apps.

You don't even know how many. Who's [keeping count](on-counting)?

You have a lot of data.

Look at your cloud drives, your download folder, your browser history, your access logs. There are treasures in there.

You pay to store data you will never use. Then you hire a vendor to sell you someone else's data.

You have the ability to herd fleets of compute nodes and wrangle data streams across networks. 

You don't need more stuff.
