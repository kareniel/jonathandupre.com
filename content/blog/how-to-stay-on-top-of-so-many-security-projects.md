Security involves many recurring tasks, and it's hard to stay on top of it all. Things don't get done, you miss deadlines, and you forget about it until some strategic initiative comes up. 

It's often a result of doing too many things at once. Scheduling ends up all over the place.

If you standardize the duration of work items, you can use Little's Law to predict your lead time. You can then get a sense of how much work you will be able to ship in a given quarter without having to worry about scheduling.

Throw all the work in a single queue, and limit the amount of work in progress.

You can calculate your lead time by dividing your production capacity by your production throughput.

`Lead time = Work in Progress / Throughput`

If you can control the amount of work in progress, you can stop managing time.
