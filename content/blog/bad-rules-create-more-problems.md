Some companies will require that you have a given set of policies in place before working with you.

They might be trying to figure out what rules you put in place and how you make sure that people follow them. Or they might be trying to add friction is the sales process.

But the goal of a policy is to reduce risk by communicating clear rules to staff members.

It's not just the document, it's the organizational change that comes with it.

Asking an intern to write your rules for you might help you sign that contract tomorrow, but might line you up with more trouble down the line. Bad rules create more problem than they solve.

When someone asks you if you have a given policy in a security questionnaire, tell the truth. It's the best policy.
