At the gym, you do exercises in sets. Each set has a number of repetitions, or reps.

The weights should get heavier as you progress. It would be impractical to buy infinite weights, so you buy them in fixed weight increments.

You use a range for your number of reps because you have a discrete number of weights. Ranges have a lower and an upper bound. They are useful because they give you room for manoeuvre. 

In a perfect world, you would address risk in real-time. But you work as teams and organize work in projects. And deadlines mean pressure.

So your number of reps should reflect your goals. You should expect less reps per set if you are working with heavier weights.

Having trouble reaching the lower bound is a sign that your goals are too ambitious. 

Reaching the upper bound with ease for too long is a sign of stagnation.

But when you get close to the upper bound after honest effort, it's a sign you are ready for the next level.
