title: Lost time and productivity tax

Sometimes you have to fix something fast. And that fix sticks around. A year later, it's part of someone else's weird ritual for keeping production alive.

Computers are great at repetition. But when we run scripts by hand in production:

- We make mistakes.
- We spend unplanned time troubleshooting.
- We stay at work longer to catch up on deadlines.

The amount of wasted effort makes no sense.

You pay so much in lost time and productivity. Sometimes in accrued technical debt. Borrow time from feature development. Invest it upfront in [reproducible builds](get-the-build-automated) and immutable infrastructure. 

You can pay it back in faster deployments, reduced outages, and better estimates.
