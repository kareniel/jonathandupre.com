That one integration. 

It made us way more productive. This guy has been working on it for a while, now. He used this new web app that lets you connect two APIs together without writing code.

But he left a month ago. And he didn't really document it. 

No one knows how the integration works. We just don't touch it.

But yeah, it's business critical. If it fails, it will probably [take operations down](classify-incident-severity) until we fix it. Who knows how long that could take. 

It probably won't fail, though.

Right?
