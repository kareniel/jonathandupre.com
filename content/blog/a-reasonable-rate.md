Vulnerabilities accumulate.

Their volume over time correlates with a probability of being exploited. 

So you want to fix your bugs at a reasonable rate.

But first you have to figure out what a reasonable rate is. And make it explicit with every stakeholder in your contracts.

If you then invest in a reliable way to measure that rate, you can free yourself from operations to think at a more strategic level.

Your job is not to not make mistakes. It's to fix your mistakes at a reasonable rate.
