Cyber risk comes in various [shapes and sizes](using-both-risk-control-levers).

What it looks like influences how you prepare.

1. **Likely and high impact**: Fix this now. Deploy changes and hunt down threats.
2. **Likely and low impact**: Focus on prevention. Manage risks, inventory assets, and model threats. You want to be systematic.
3. **Unlikely and high impact**: Focus on recovery. Have a contingency plan, build redundant systems, and train people. You want to be ready.
4. **Unlikely and low impact**: Follow best practices. Stay vigilant. Remember that small things add up.

You control likelihood by making sure it doesn't happen. And you control impact by being ready to adapt.
