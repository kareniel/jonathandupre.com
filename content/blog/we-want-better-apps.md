Apps improve with data. The more data you have, the better the app's ability to know your wants and needs.

The more data, the more private data. The more private data, the more liability.

So there's an inherent risk to better apps.

- Sometimes you'll be ready to handle it. 
- Sometimes you have to accept it, because that's the way it is. 
- Sometimes that's unacceptable, you don't have the resources to handle it. 
- Sometimes you can plan ahead and invest in an action plan.

We want better apps, which means we should expect [some level of risk](the-price-of-inaction).
