Over the past year, you won X out of Y attempts. That's your success rate.

If your success rate is 10%, and you want to win 10 times, you have to play 100 times.

That's `desired number of wins * number of past attempts / number of past wins`.

The inverse of your success rate is the multiplier you have to pay to reach your goal.

You can increase your success rate, or you can play more often.

Improving your success rate gives you the most leverage. But playing more often is always under your control.
