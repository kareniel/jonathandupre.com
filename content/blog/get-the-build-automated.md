If you can't build the same artifact twice, [your tests](test-your-assumptions) won't mean much.

You should be able to build the whole system with a single command. 

If you don't have this yet, make sure you get it done before the contract with your security auditor starts. It will save them time which means more time to find bugs and more bang for your buck.
