Your projects will either ship on time or they won't. When they don't, you have an opportunity. It's your chance to learn and improve. 

It's the same with security incidents. You could take the hit, pay the price, and move on. Or you can use this opportunity to self-reflect. "What decisions did we make that led us to this outcome?".

These discussions won't happen on their own. Our natural tendency is to point fingers and blame each other. That's why you need to decide what you will do before the bad stuff happens. 

You can become a disorganized mess, or you can [become a learning organization](take-one-step). It's your choice. But you don't get to have both.
