You don't discover risks when doing security reviews. You discover issues about some of your security controls. You find out in what ways they are vulnerable.

A risk is an uncertain future event with meaningful consequences. 

You describe security risks through scenarios that might happen in the future: 

> "During `<a time period>`, `<a threat>` abuses `<a set of vulnerabilities>` in the `<security controls>` protecting `<a set of systems>`, reducing the likelihood of reaching a `<business goal>` by `<a ratio>`".

Vulnerability is only one part of the story. 

Until you provide every component of the risk scenario, you won't know if the impact is meaningful.

1. Adjust `<time periods>` to the event horizon you are looking at.
2. Conduct inventory management and architecture reviews to get a list of your `<systems>` and `<security controls>`.
3. Do vulnerability assessments, configuration reviews, and penetration tests to identify `<vulnerabilities>`.
4. Perform threat modeling and gather threat intelligence to identify `<threats>`.

Use forecasting to estimate the impact on the bottom-line, and focus on protecting business goals. 

Measuring risk will help you prioritize potential remediations with the other important things that your budget can buy.
