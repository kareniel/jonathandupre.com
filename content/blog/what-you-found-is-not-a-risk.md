title: What you found is not risk

You don't discover risks when doing security reviews. You discover issues about some of your security controls. You find out in what ways they are vulnerable.

A risk is an uncertain future event with meaningful consequences. 

You describe risks through scenarios that might happen in the future: 

> "During `<a time period>`, `<a threat>` abuses `<a set of vulnerabilities>` in `<a set of systems>` reducing the probability of reaching a `<business goal>` by `<a ratio>`".

1. Adjust `<time periods>` to the event horizon you are looking at.
2. Conduct inventory management and architecture reviews to get a list of your `<systems>`.
3. Do vulnerability assessments, configuration reviews, and penetration tests to identify `<vulnerabilities>`.
4. Perform threat modeling and gather threat intelligence to identify `<threats>`.

Focus on `<business goals>` that are relevant today, and use forecasting to get probability reduction `<ratios>`.

Until you provide every component of the risk scenario, you won't know if the impact is meaningful.
