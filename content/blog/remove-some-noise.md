Information gets stale over time. Someone's phone number from 10 years might not be assigned to the same person anymore. 

One way to add value in security projects is by removing noise. 
Sometimes you have enough information, but you also have too much of it to sift through. 

Bad information can sometimes be worse than no information at all.

Look for ways that you can delete a draft you never finished, archive documentation that is out of date, or retire a whole app no one is using anymore. 

Burn the old wood before it rots.
