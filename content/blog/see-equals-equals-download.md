description: If someone has read access to a file, assume they will copy it and distribute it to their peers.

With a Xerox machine, you could copy information thousands of times a day. With a modern computer, you can copy information as much as you want. All day.

You can now duplicate a secret at the speed of a social network. 

Having read access means being allowed to ask questions about a set of numbers.

You can ask a computer for the contents of a file, or your eyes for the color of the sky.
If someone has read access to a file, assume they will copy it and distribute it to their peers. 

Computers, like people, are networked by default.
