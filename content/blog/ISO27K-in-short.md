The ISO27K standard is very much a specification for a management system. That is, a system to manage your information security efforts. It helps you organize your activities in such a way that you know where you are, you know where you're going, and you track your progress as you go. It also gives you the tools to confirm that the controls that you put in place are working as intented. In short, the standard gives you the structure needed so you can go back to building your product and trust that you are staying on top of your cybersecurity game.
