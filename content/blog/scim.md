The "System for Cross-domain Identity Management", or SCIM, is an application-level provisioning protocol.

It provides a schema for core identity resources (such as users and groups) and a set of REST operations.

The documentation explains its purpose well. "Make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud".

The API is implemented by many Identity Providers (like Okta) and it lets you provision users automatically on apps like GitHub, AWS SSO, and Jira.
