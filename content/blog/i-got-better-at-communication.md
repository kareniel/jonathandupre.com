We get better security outcomes when we improve our communication skills.

I'm not the best, but I'm the proof that you can get better.

Here are some of the things I did that helped me get better at interacting with others.

**Service jobs**: I worked for over a year in a bookstore, a year at a DVD rental, and a summer at a gas station.

**Socializing**: I participated in 5 applied improvisation workshops and 20 silent disco parties. I played clubs as a DJ in front of crowds of 500 people.

**Public speaking**: I gave talks at a community center, a public library, a church, and a university.

**Hypnosis & coaching**: Hypnosis is a lot about communication. I got certified twice. I watched 1,000 hours of training videos. I read 50 books about psychology, sociology, and communication. I helped a handful of people around me.

**Writing**: I've been writing on my blog and social media since 2012. I write one blog post every weekday since January 2022. 

As a teenager, I was too anxious to call for pizza. Now, I feel confident speaking at board meetings.

Sometimes it's good to sit back and remember all the progress you've made. A big part of progression is in noticing it.
