As a vendor protecting my data, your job comes down to 5 things:

1. Knowing where my data is
2. Controlling access to it
3. Monitoring anomalies
4. Taking action if something goes wrong
5. Making sure that the monitoring works properly

To be successful, you need to figure out how to do this on a continuous basis, and to get better at it over time.
