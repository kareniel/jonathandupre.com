You can have the best design in the world, but if you don't test the implementation, you won't realize that things might go wrong.

Modern IT infrastructures change quickly, and assumptions don't age well.

Where do you think your beloved app is the weakest? 

Try to break it.

Keep track of the steps you take to test things and see if you can automate them. Then run those on every deploy.

You will be wrong one day. Make sure you find out early.
