We want things to happen the way we predicted. So we don't assess our assumptions.

When you question stories you've been telling yourself, you unleash uncertainty. Accurate insights can be unpleasant.

Who wants to pull on the thread that seems to be holding the sweater together?

To really see, you need to be away from the urgent, the day to day. You need to give yourself perspective. And when you step back and look at things on a larger scale, you don't always like what you see.

But not looking is worse. Because you know this will get worse later. 
Dead tech rots. Then it grows into a monster.

So you address problems as they arise, you sort them out as you go.

You refuse to pay the price of inaction.

Accurate insights can be unpleasant.
