Why does data accumulate so much? Why do we always need more RAM, more storage space?

I don't have a clear answer to those questions. But I can share an observation that might help you think this through. Or lead you to some insight.

To count without having a concept of a number, you need some sort of a counter. Tally marks, fingers on a hand, shells.

Imagine you're counting sheep using pebbles.

A complete count of every sheep will produce an equal amount of pebbles.

Now, you could re-use the same pebbles twice.

But if you want to store the first number, you will need to store the pebbles. You will have to use a new set of pebbles to count a new number.
