Sometimes we write private information on sheets of paper.

If you always kept one side of them blank, you could count on them to keep your information private. You know you could always just flip them over.

Standards give you [assurance](information-assurance) in two ways:

1. **They give you a description of what to expect.** Flipping over sheets of paper hides private information.
2. **They give you something to verify.** There shouldn't be anything written on the back of sheets of paper.
