AML regulations are innefective

mechanism to combat money laundering

If authorities recover around $3 billion per annum from criminals, whilst imposing compliance costs of $300 billion and penalizing businesses another $8 billion a year, it is reasonable to ask if the real target of anti-money laundering laws is legitimate enterprises rather than criminal enterprises.

It is reasonable also to ask whether ordinary citizens are harmed more than banks
and criminals, at least financially, by laws ostensibly aimed at financial crime. After
all, banks typically pass their costs on to shareholders and customers - in lower divi-
dends, higher fees, lower interest rates for savers, and higher rates for borrowers.

Moreover, taxpayers pay the costs of government, including scores of international
agencies involved in the anti-money laundering agenda, and up to several dozen gov-
ernment agencies in each of 205 countries and jurisdictions. Individuals, commun-
ities, economies, and society also suffer the economic and social harms from
serious crime.

it is simply “taken for granted that actions taken against
money laundering and especially the financing of terrorism will have a positive welfare
impact, both gross and net of costs

the oft-proclaimed benefits of anti-money laundering efforts are seldom quantified or tested robustly, despite researchers “howl[ing] into the wind their warnings of unintended consequences, of law and regulations with costs far exceeding ephemeral benefits ... only to be totally ignored” (Cochrane 2014, 2).

less than one-quarter of one per cent of the proceeds of crime laundered via the financial system is seized and frozen

when regulations prove to be this inefficient, they are nothing more than a tax on progress and privacy

The current framework in which financial institutions fulfill their role against financial crime is end of life

The vast efforts do not necessarily result in a safer world

These regulations have implications for society, such as the impact of mass financial surveillance on citizens' privacy.

Detecting transactions that might be associated with the financing of terrorism is incredibly difficult

Only about 10% of their reports result in further investigation, and most of that relates to suspicions of money laundering

The focus is on compliance with rules, not successful outcomes.

In practice there is limited success in terms of detecting transactions that might be associated with the financing of terrorism

The unintended consequences of the system, such as the financial exclusion of high-risk groups of customers

Banks have carry out customer research, monitor transactions and report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). 

Misalignment has emerged between the regulations that oblige banks to detect and prevent terrorist financing and the practical reality within banks

We need to be clear about the objectives motivating the creation of tools to combat terrorist financing and whether these objectives are being achieved

The role to be played by private actors in far-reaching security decisions is a political matter
