Arbitrage bots 

monitor pending transactions 
attempt to exploit profitable opportunities created by them

look for specific types of transactions in the mempool
such a DEX trade or an oracle update
and try to frontrun them according to a predetermined algorithm



generalized frontrunner, generalized frontrunning bots 
look for any transaction that they could profitably frontrun by copying it and replacing addresses with their own
execute the transaction and copy profitable internal transactions generated by its execution trace

see, copy, mutate, and frontrun my transaction

miners will reorder and submit transactions in their mempools for their benefit
