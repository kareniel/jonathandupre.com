Improve the organization's security maturity so that you're able to trust yourself more as time goes on.

Here are some ways you can start creating a continuous improvement cycle.

- Write specifications for your systems. You probably won't do it before you start but it's never too late.
- Simplify the architecture. Lower cognitive overhead means less bugs.
- Build tools around the development process. Optimize for developer workflows.

You can't depend on an external company to do this work for you.
It's core to your business to understand your product and be able to manage it.
