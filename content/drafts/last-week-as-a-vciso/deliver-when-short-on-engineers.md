## Security's first home inside devops

At startups, security often starts inside the IT ops team.
This is your SREs, devops engineers, and your system administrators.

This team gets inbound requests for all kinds of things. Developers need some infrastructure component deployed, customer support needs technical help, and outages need to be fixed.

That means the people responsible for implementing new security solutions will be busy doing unplanned work.

## Not enough qualified staff

One of the main pain points I hear from leadership is a lack of capacity to do the work. There's just not enough people.

Managers find it difficult to find new hires. But it's not that suprising since we expect people in these roles to wear so many hats.

With so much unplanned work, operators get more and more busy responding to internal requests.

The event horizon gets blurry, and you end up with lower visibility into the future.

As a result, they have many to-dos, but no real sense of priority other than keeping production up.

With limited resources, the question becomes: "What do we focus on next?".

## Picking what to focus on

With the right effort, solutions to common issues can be automated away and time reclaimed for business projects. But first you need a bit of visibility. It could be visibility for you, ie: knowing when things break, or for stakeholders, ie: PMs know how time spent firefighting will impact deadlines.

What to focus on often involves analysing the source of that unplanned work.

If you can find out where it comes from, you can focus your effort there. 

Is it tech support?

Document the steps you follow to fulfill a request.
Add that information to the company documentation.
A well-document process can be followed by somebody else.

Is it urgent feature requests?

Keep a dialogue open with product team and track the business case for new products.
With increased awareness of where the business plans to go, operators can position themselves ahead of time and be ready to deliver.

Is it compliance reviews?

A well-documented security program will let you answer compliance questions orders of magnitude faster. An up-to-date assets inventory with system ownership also helps. If done the right way, work can be distributed outside the security team.

Is it production outages?

Start with immutable infrastructure. Once it becomes standard practice avoid touching production, start tracking change failure rate. Try to keep that number low.

## Adaptive roadmaps embrace unplanned work

Security roadmaps need to be adaptive. Design your roadmap in terms of process.

How do we set ourselves up for success? We take a step back from the doing and we start organizing the way we work.

The business process is responsible for getting the results. Whoever runs the playbook is responsible for following the steps correctly. Once the process has been reviewed, you start getting some assurance about the future state. This can then be delegated to a more junior position or maybe even automated.

Instead of thinking "How can I fix this problem?", start considering "How can I put a system in place so that this category of problems doesn't come up again in the future?".
