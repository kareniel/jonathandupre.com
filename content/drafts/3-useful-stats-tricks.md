logistic regression

log(P(x)/(1-P(x)))

P(x) < .5 -> -

P(x) = .5 -> 0

add up the effects of independent different conditions on a probability

LOR(P(Event))
LOR(P(Event | Condition))
LOR(P(Event | No condition))

delta LOR = L(w/condition) - L(baseline)
adjusted LOR = baseline LOR + all delta LORs
adjusted probability = 1 / (1 + 1 / exp(Adjusted LOR))
